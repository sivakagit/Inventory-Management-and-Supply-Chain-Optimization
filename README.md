# 📦 Inventory Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

*A complete end-to-end retail demand forecasting pipeline.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project builds a full Machine Learning pipeline for **predicting product demand** using a real-world retail transaction dataset.
The workflow includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation**—all aligned with modern inventory and supply chain research trends.

The objective is to accurately forecast **Total Purchases**, enabling smarter inventory planning, reduced stockouts, and improved operational efficiency.

## 🧱 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove PII, fix types, impute missing values, cap outliers.
2. **EDA**

   * Time-series trends, sales distributions, category analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Date parts, lag features, rolling averages, encoded categories.
4. **Model Training**

   * Compare ML vs DL forecasting performance.
5. **Evaluation**

   * RMSE, MAE, MAPE metrics.
6. **Forecasting & Insights**

   * Predict future demand for better inventory planning.

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

* Customer transactions
* Product category & brand
* Order status, payment method, shipping method
* Total purchases & order amount
* Geographic information (city, state, country)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
* TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)
